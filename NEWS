version 0.1-3
released 2012-08-10
      - Exact version of Wald-Wolfowitz runs test implemented. See ?runs.pvalue.
      - Random list now contains also a sequence number. May be better suited
        to detect patterns in the random list if more than 2 sequences are used. 
      - 'Randomness' control in function RL4() in case of more than 2 sequences 
        now tests the occurrence of repeated patterns of sequences hard coded. 
        Example seqno= 1 2 3 1 2 3 ... will be recognised and avoided.
